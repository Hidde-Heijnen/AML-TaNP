# TaNP

The source code is based on the paper: ‚ÄùTask-adaptive Neural Process for User Cold-Start Recommendation" accepted in WWW 2021.

For the MPhil MLMI at the university of Cambridge, we've improved the code to support multiple datasets out of the box, and implemented the missing default decoder.

## Datasets

MoviesLens-1M is provided by MeLU, and you can find it from [here](https://github.com/hoyeoplee/MeLU).  
 Last.FM is provided by HetRec, and you can find it from [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-%202011/).

## How to use

Use the following commands for running setting up the datasets and start running:

1. unzip data.zip file
2. unzip lastfm_hetrec.zip
3. drag the lastfmfm_hetrec folder into the data folder
4. run:

```bash
chmod +x TaNP/clone_movielens_dataset.sh
TaNP/clone_movielens_dataset.sh
```

5. zsh train.sh # Training with default hyper-parameters.
